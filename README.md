# GetNthUppercaseService

A simple java service using a TDD approach that, given a text, returns every Nth character from that text that is uppercase. 
N is a configurable parameter.



Given "ITCLiNicAl" and N = 1, the return value will be "ITCLNA";


The Service also returns every Nth character from the input text that is either an uppercase letter, a number, or a special character. For example:
 
 Given "!tCL1Nical" and N = 1, the return value will be "!CL1N"

The Service also prints a count of each type of character returned. For example:
 
 Given "ItCLINiCAL" and N = 1, the return value will be "ICLINCAL", and the following output will be printed in the console:
 
 I = 2
 
 C = 2
 
 L = 2
 
 N = 1
 
 A = 1
